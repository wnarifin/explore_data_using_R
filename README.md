## Errata:

### 1.3 Functions and Objects, page 10:
The object names (X, Y, Z) are capitalized. These should be x, y, and z instead.

### 2.4.3 Selecting based on logical expressions, page 32:
Operators for the expressions are missing. These should be:

1. Equal ==
2. More than or equal >=
3. Less than or equal <=
4. More than >
5. Less than <
6. Not equal !=

We apologize for the printing errors.
